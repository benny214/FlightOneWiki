# VBAT Power

# Lightning H7 - VBAT
For the VTX and/or FPV camera to use vbat (Lipo power) you will need to remove the corresponding resistor, and only when this is done you can bridge the vbat pads.

1. Resistor you will remove
    1. Left = FPV Camera power
    1. Right = VTX power
1. Pads to bridge, marked with "x"
